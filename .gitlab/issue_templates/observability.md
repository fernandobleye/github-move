<!--
I see you're filing an issue for the observability SRE team. This process differs depending on what kind of work this is.

Please write a clear description of the problem in the issue description, and acceptance criteria. Give the issue a terse but descriptive title.

If you aren't a team member and are requesting work from the observability SRE team, you don't have to do anything special with labels beyond what's already in this template. This issue will be triaged and inserted into our prioritized backlog.

If you are a team member writing an issue for project work, don't forget to:

- Put the issue in its epic
- assign a weight based on perceived complexity and how much of the problem space is unknown: 1, 2 or 4

See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/observability/ for a description of our workflow.

Remember to keep your epics in order of priority / necessity, to indicate to the team lead and engineering manager that you would like it to be inserted into the backlog.
